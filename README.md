# Ember Engine 3D

This 3D engine is developed using Python, OpenGL, Pygame, ImGui docking, and Impasse. \
It demonstrates the core principles of 3D rendering and interactive graphics.

The primary goal of this project is to gain more knowledge in Python programming.

“Because of Python's limitations, it is not typically used for 3D graphics applications. However, I still value it as a good exercise!”
